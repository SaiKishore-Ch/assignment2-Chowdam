###### My favorite place is California
> From Hollywood dreams to Silicon Valley start-ups; from Napa Valley vineyards to miles of free beaches, California is one of the most **beautiful and livable places in America**. Whether youâ€™re climbing the corporate ladder or El Capitan in Yosemite Valley, The Golden State is the place for you.
